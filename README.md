At dawn, when the bakery filled with the warm smell of fresh bread and sugar, the mice were the first to appear. They crept out from behind sacks of flour, their tiny paws leaving soft trails in the dust as they searched for crumbs and forgotten pieces of pastry. To them, the bakery was a kingdom of endless treats.

Soon after, the cats arrived. They stretched lazily on the counters, their whiskers twitching as they watched everything from above. Their eyes followed every small movement, even though they pretended not to care. The mice felt those eyes and scurried faster, whispering warnings to one another.

One brave mouse dragged a crumb nearly as big as himself across the floor, while another stood guard. A cat flicked its tail, and the mice froze, hearts pounding. But the cat only yawned and rolled onto its side, as if the whole chase was beneath it.
